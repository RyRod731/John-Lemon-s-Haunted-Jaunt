# John-Lemon-s-Haunted-Jaunt

For my Final Assignement it was just me Ryan Rodriguez who worked on my version of John Lemon's Haunted Jaunt.

I did two Minor Mods just in case the first one didn't count and that was the one direction facing ghosts and the other minor mod I did as a back up was the Speed Boost. For the Major Mod I added a countdown timer to the game.
